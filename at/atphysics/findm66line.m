%FINDM66 numerically finds the 6x6 transfer matrix of an accelerator lattice
%  by differentiation of LINEPASS near the closed orbit
%  FINDM66 uses FINDORBIT6 to search for the closed orbit in 6-d
%  In order for this to work the ring MUST have a CAVITY element
%
% M66 = FINDM66(RING)finds full one-turn 6-by-6
%    matrix at the entrance of the first element
%
% [M66,T] = FINDM66(RING, REFPTS, R0) in addition to M finds 
%           R0 = findorbit6(RING,REFPTS)
% For transport lines
% [M66,T] = FINDM66(RING,REFPTS, [0 0 0 0 0 0]')
%
%    6-by-6 transfer matrixes  between entrances of 
%    the first element and each element indexed by REFPTS. 
%    T is 6-by-6-by-length(REFPTS) 3 dimentional array. 
%    
%    REFPTS is an array of increasing indexes that  select elements 
%    from the range 1 to length(RING)+1. 
%    See further explanation of REFPTS in the 'help' for FINDSPOS 
%    When REFPTS is a vector FINDM44 is a 6-by-6-by-length(REFPTS) array
%    so that the set of indexes (:,:,i) selects the 6-by-6 
%    matrix at the i-th reference point
%    
%    Note: 
%    When REFPTS= [ 1 2 .. ] the fist point is the entrance of the first element
%    and T(:,:,1) - identity matrix
%    When REFPTS= [  .. length(RING)+1] the last point is the exit of the last element
%    and the entrance of the first element after 1 turn: T(:,:, ) = M
%
% [M66, T, orbit] = FINDM66(RING, REFPTS) in addition returns the closed orbit
%    found in the process of lenearization
