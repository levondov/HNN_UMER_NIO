function orbit = findorbit6(RING,varargin)
%FINDORBIT6 finds closed orbit in the full 6-d phase space
% by numerically solving  for a fixed point of the one turn 
% map M calculated with RINGPASS
% 
% (X, PX, Y, PY, DP, CT2 ) = M (X, PX, Y, PY, DP, CT1)
% 
% with constraint % CT2 - CT1 = C*HarmNumber(1/Frf - 1/Frf0)
% 
% IMPORTANT!!! FINDORBIT6 is a realistic simulation
% 1. The Frf frequency in the RF cavities (may be different from Frf0) 
%    imposes the synchronous condition 
%    CT2 - CT1 = C*HarmNumber(1/Frf - 1/Frf0)
% 2. The algorithm numerically calculates   
%    6-by-6 Jacobian matrix J6. In order for (J-E) matrix 
%    to be non-singular it is NECESSARY to use a realistic 
%    PassMethod for cavities with non-zero momentum kick 
%    (such as CavityPass).
% 3. FINDORBIT6 can find orbits with radiation. 
%    In order for the solution to exist the cavity must supply
%    adequate energy compensation. 
%    In the simplest case of a single cavity, it must have 
%    'Voltage' field set so that Voltage > Erad - energy loss per turn 
% 4. FINDORBIT6 starts the search from [ 0 0 0 0 0 0 ]', unless
%    the third argument is specified: FINDORBIT6(RING,REFPTS,GUESS)
%    There exist a family of solutions that correspond to different RF buckets 
%    They differ in the 6-th coordinate by C*Nb/Frf. Nb = 1 .. HarmNum-1
% 5. The value of the 6-th coordinate found at the cavity gives
%    the equilibrium RF phase. If there is no radiation the phase is 0;
% 
% FINDORBIT6(RING) is 6x1 vector - fixed point at the 
%		entrance of the 1-st element of the RING (x,px,y,py,dp,ct)
%
% FINDORBIT6(RING,REFPTS) is 6-by-Length(REFPTS)
%     array of column vectors - fixed points (x,px,y,py,dp,ct)
%     at the entrance of each element indexed  REFPTS array. 
%     REFPTS is an array of increasing indexes that  select elements 
%     from the range 1 to length(RING)+1. 
%     See further explanation of REFPTS in the 'help' for FINDSPO
%
% FINDORBIT6(RING,REFPTS,GUESS) - same as above but the search
%     for the fixed point starts at the initial condition GUESS
%     GUESS must be a 6-by-1 vector;
%
% [ORBIT, FIXEDPOINT] = FINDORBIT6( ... )
%     The optional second return parameter is 
%     a 6-by-1 vector of initial conditions 
%     on the close orbit at the entrance to the RING.
